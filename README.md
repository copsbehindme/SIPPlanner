# SIPPlanner
A basic SIP Planner made using Android and MPCharts Library

SIPPlanner

A simple Systematic Investment Planner.

The basic fundamental of SIP is that you invest a little money every month in some funds. These give you a little more interest than what a bank gives you. (Not true everytime). If you wish to buy a car that would cost , say x , you can start investing a certain amount of money from today.

So how much money would you need to invest to reach the goal? This problem is solved by SIP Planner.

Not only it lets you calculate the money for monthly investment. But it also lets you calculate total return in case of consistent money investment every month.

There are a few drawbacks of the app as of now : The rate of interest has to be set by user beforehand. So there is a little uncertainity. But if you research a fund for a little time you can easily calculate how much return it will gonna give in the long run.
